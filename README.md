## Use

### Configuration file
Make sure you have a file /home/USER/.geryonfs.ini with the following structure:

```
[mongofs]
username =
password =
database =
collection =
host =
```

You can also set the file in other path as long as you pass the path in the config variable to the mount python binary.

### Command to mount the Mongo file system

```bash
python geryon-fs/bin/mount.py --mountpoint /home/USER/tmp/mongofs --config /home/USER/.geryonfs.ini
```

If your config file is in **/home/USER/.geryonfs.ini** you can omit the config parameter:

```bash
python geryon-fs/bin/mount.py --mountpoint /home/USER/tmp/mongofs
```

## FAQs

### Why the name?

As far as I know, MongoDB took its name from humongous (i.e. enormous), Geryon was a monster from Greek mythology that
lived in Erytheia (current [CÃ¡diz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A1diz)). As he was a giant,
I thought it could be a good name for a MongoDB driver.
