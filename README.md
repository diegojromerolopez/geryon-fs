## FAQs

### Why the name?

As far as I know, MongoDB took its name from humongous (i.e. enormous), Geryon was a monster from Greek mythology that
lived in Erytheia (current [CÃ¡diz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A1diz)). As he was a giant,
I thought it could be a good name for a MongoDB driver.
